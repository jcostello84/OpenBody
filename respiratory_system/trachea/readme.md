The trachea, colloquially called the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with lungs. The aim of this part of the project is to generate a 3d rendering og the human trachea as well as the tracheal cartilage which wraps the trachea. Ultimiately the overall goal is to provide a easy to manipulate template for generating replacement trachea's using stemcells, so that those who suffer from Trachaelstenosis or other trachea related issues, have a way to receive a replacement trachea.

For more information on the trachea, please see article [Trachea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachea).


Images found in the medical_images directory which were used to help design the trachea, were gathered from the following sources:
